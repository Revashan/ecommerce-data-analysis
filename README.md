## Dataset

The raw data consists of 8 relational tables from Olist:

| File | Description |

| `olist_orders_dataset.csv` | Order status and timestamps |
| `olist_order_items_dataset.csv` | Items per order with pricing |
| `olist_order_payments_dataset.csv` | Payment type and installments |

## Data Cleaning

Handled in `notebooks/datacleaning.ipynb`:

- Merged orders, customers, items, products, and payments into a single flat table
- Standardized date columns and extracted `year` and `month` features
- Filled or flagged missing product category names as `unknown`
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
- Output saved to `data/processed/cleaned_ecommerce.csv`

**Tools used:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Power BI Dashboard

The cleaned dataset was loaded into Power BI to build an interactive executive dashboard.

- Customer distribution by state
- Payment method breakdown
- Delivery performance metrics

The `.pbix` file is available at `powerbi/dash.pbix`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   ```
3. Run `notebooks/datacleaning.ipynb` to reproduce the cleaned dataset
4. Open `powerbi/dash.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard

  ## Key Business Insights
   1. Revenue Concentration
A small number of states contribute majority of total revenue
 Insight: Business is geographically

2.Product Performance
Few categories generate most revenue
Long-tail categories contribute very little

3.Customer Behavior
Majority of customers are one-time buyers
Repeat customers form a small but high-value segment

4.Sales Trend
Sales show seasonal spikes
Certain months outperform significantly

5.Revenue vs Orders
High number of orders does not always mean high revenue

## Advanced Insights
1.Customer Segmentation

Using clustering:

## High-value customers
Medium-value customers
Low-value customers

## Order Value Distribution
Most orders are low to medium value
Few high-value outliers
